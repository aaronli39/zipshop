This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Zipshop
This will be an Amazon API powered and Amazon themed e-commerce app for me to learn about React, state management, and Firebase

-----
## Installation
1) in the root directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies
2) run `npm start` to start the localhost in a new tab

-----
## Features (thus far)
* Firebase auth used to create users with email and password, and sign them in
* React Contexts is used to provide a data layer for state management (number of items in cart, subtotal, removing items from basket, etc)
* Checkout will use Stripe for payment when complete
* Will use Amazon Products API to search and display Amazon products
