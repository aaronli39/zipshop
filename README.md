# Zipshop
This is an Amazon themed e-commerce site with a few static products. The purpose of this project was for me to learn React, React Contexts API, React Hooks, Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Functions.

-----
## Installation
1) in the root directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies
2) run `npm start` to start the localhost in a new tab

-----
## Features (thus far)
* Firebase auth used to create users with email and password, and sign them in
* React Contexts is used to provide a data layer for state management (number of items in cart, subtotal, removing items from basket, etc)
* Checkout will use Stripe for payment when complete
* Will use Amazon Products API to search and display Amazon products
